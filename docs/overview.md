# Overview

To penetrate the block of information caused by GFW, people are constantly trying to design unidentifiable protocols with strong encryption and obfuscation to cheat GFW's filter. As it turns out, the best practice is to mimic other protocols, such as HTTPS. Trojan, however, has taken a huge step forward: it just "is" HTTPS, or at least GFW will think it only just "is" an HTTPS server.

In the [next page](protocol), we'll see how trojan protocol works and why it can defend itself from being detected both actively and passively.
