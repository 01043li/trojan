# Overview

On penetrating GFW, people assume that strong encryption and obfuscation may cheat GFW's ever-evolving filtration mechanism. However, imho, the best camouflage is to mimic other protocols, such as the well-known `HTTPS`. Trojan implements this idea: it "is" `HTTPS`, or at least tries trick GFW into thinking so.

The [next page](protocol) introduces the trojan protocol, and how it hides itself from active and passive detections.
